/**
 * Hey. My name is Zak. A skilled React developer who focuses 
 * on JavaScript first programming but is well aware of the state management system 
 * behind react that needs to be well integrated with your JavaScript code. React won't react to 
 * JavaScript unless you tell it to with the correct hooks. I love using Typescript and have coded my 
 * last two projects fully in typescript code. Using it to create schemes and using the built in js doc code 
 * commenting language I write very clean, easily understood files that allow people to quickly follow my code. 
 * I start every file with a commented todo list of tasks that are Done => In Review => TODO.
I'm sure you'll take pleasure in working with me.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * I've never done a project exactly like this. But my most recent projects are a Mobile App 
 * written is react native. 
 * It's a social media app that I wrote entirely in Typescript. I integrated features like Webrtc,
 *  Locational tracking and updating and Branch IO for deep linking.
Another project I've recently worked on was a video streaming website using Next.js, 
Typescript. Where I wrote the front end styles in tailwind css and used Next.js' server 
side rendering feature to preload content onto page.
Both of these projects were written using very tight state management techniques that
 tied the React DOM and the Brower Dom into one efficient unit
